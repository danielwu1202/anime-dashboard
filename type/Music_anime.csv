Here comes the end
Our land is brutally torn apart by conglomerates
Redevelopment swept across the city
Their thriving business had left us homeless

Rotten city, rotten crowd
Luxury clothing won't conceal the stench
Top yourself and throw a curse
Fill the streets with our merry hearses

Is the world going to end
as we've been longing for?
Destroy us all together with the chaos
Set us free like
the ashes in the wind

A story of a child who has been inheriting a negative legacy of humankind that continuously accumulates in diverse ways. The child keeps carrying the legacy, that is too heavy and too much to bear for her body, feverishly without knowing the real meaning of the act.

Soon, the child starts to act out a vision of knowledge, prayers, courage and curiosity. She realizes that positive power is the best balance towards purification and she should stop carrying on the negativity through a negative attitude.

Children Record
Long ago, the heat-haze began drawing in victims, granting them red-eyed powers—but these powers bring more pain than good. Through the despair, these affected children push ever onward to a future full of hope.

Yuukei Yesterday
For a tsundere like Takane Enomoto, falling in love is the worst possible predicament. This couldn't be any worse, as the object of her affection is her oblivious classmate Haruka Kokonose. With their dispositions, Takane will never confess and Haruka will never notice. Maybe, however, she will finally be able to muster the courage to convey her feelings for him before the sun sets.

Outer Science
Within the Heat Haze Daze, Kuroha rests beside his imprisoned former master, awaiting the next master—Mari Kozakura. No matter how she tries to rewrite the future, Mari is inevitably faced with tragedy, desperate to save those who matter most to her. But despair is never-ending, and what awaits her is an endless cycle of anguish. Not that it matters, as Kuroha will always be waiting...

Summer Time Record
As the story of the Mekakushi-dan draws to a close, its members reminisce of times gone by. These children, who may have never met otherwise, are connected by the past. However, as they finally approach the end, they resolve to remember, hoping to one day meet again.

Shounen Brave
Kousuke Seto lacks courage more than anything else. Relentlessly bullied, his only friend is a dog, with whom he shares a bond that needs no words. However, this solace is destroyed by a tragedy, which burdens Seto with the red-eye power to hear others' thoughts. Haunted by the hurtful things he hears, he runs off, leading him to a fateful encounter. If it is for the sake of this person, Seto may finally have what it takes to be a little brave.

30924,Mikagura Gakuen Kumikyoku,ミカグラ学園組曲,Mikagura School Suite,"As a new student, Eruna Ichinomiya meets various strangers, learns about their clubs, and helps them with their problems.

Houkago Stride
Eruna was hardly prepared to go to her new school, but that's no matter. Leading it off with an enormous stride, she will hop, step, and jump her way through, showing her unparalleled motivation and optimistic outlook. One, two, three—she'll shout out her excitement with the fire of a toy gun! 

Mukiryoku Coup d'Etat
As an actor, Yuuto Akama is accustomed to playing different roles, and real life is just another one of these. He wears a practiced smile and a carefree attitude, but inside, a war is waging. A personality squashed and imprisoned... Yuuto puts down the coup d'état of his former self, all to maintain his perfect facade. But no matter how much time passes, the memories don't disappear, and he can never stop the flames of rebellion of his heart.

Uchouten Vivace
With a cheerful hop and skip, Himi Yasaka shows Eruna all the fun and excitement of the Calligraphy Club. It's a rhythmic and all-encompassing art; although calligraphy may take a bit of practice, anyone can do it. All you need is an ecstatic vivace!

Garakuta Innocence
No matter what saturation, contrast, or hue, painter Kyouma Kuzuryuu cannot create a work that is good enough. Everything, including himself, always falls short. He lies to himself that this is what he always wanted, but in the end, he is still another piece of trash. Is there any salvation for the lonesome and self-deprecating Kyouma?

Izayoi Seeing
Asuhi Imizu has lived his life secluded from others. Gazing at the night sky through his telescope, he draws new constellations in his mind. However, like the sun after a rainstorm, Eruna brightens his life, helping him open up to others. Together, they view a 16-day-old moon; all the while, Asuhi is guided by her light.

The theme of thoughtcrime is plagiarized from George Orwell's novel, ""1984."" Then, the moment it was declared that it's plagiarized, the plagiarized work changed form into a homage. The line between doing plagiarism and doing a homage seems ambiguous, and the truth is that that line doesn't exist anywhere. It holds true even when the role is reversed. A homage holds a great risk of becoming plagiarism. The lyrics to this song pays homage to Ozaki Housai's haiku and his final years of life.
