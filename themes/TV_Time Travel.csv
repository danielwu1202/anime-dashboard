He had respect, a gang of friends he could count on, and even a girlfriend. But that was twelve years ago. Today, he’s a nobody: a washed-up nonentity made fun of by children and always forced to apologize to his younger boss. A sudden news report on the Tokyo Manji Gang’s cruel murder of the only girlfriend he ever had alongside her brother only adds insult to injury. Half a second before a train ends his pitiful life for good, Takemichi flashes back to that same day twelve years ago, when he was still dating Hinata Tachibana.

After being forced to relive the very same day that began his downward spiral, Takemichi meets Hinata’s younger brother. Without thinking, he admits to his seeming death before flashing back to the past. Takemichi urges him to protect his sister before inexplicably returning to the future. Miraculously, he isn’t dead. Stranger still, the future has changed. It seems as though Takemichi can alter the flow of time.

41946,Shuumatsu no Harem,終末のハーレム,World's End Harem,"Reito Mizuhara is a medical student at the National Advanced Medical School in Tokyo who contracts a rare, lethal disease called cellular sclerosis. In order to be treated, he is put into cryogenic sleep for five years. Upon awakening, he learns that a year into his slumber, a worldwide pandemic broke out, caused by the novel Male Killer (MK) virus which exclusively afflicts males and has killed all other men on Earth. 

Fortunately, Reito and four other men were spared during their cryosleep and are now immune to the virus. As the only men left in the world, they are thus tasked with mating with as many women as possible to repopulate the planet. However, Reito is committed to his childhood friend and sole love interest, Elisa Tachibana—only to learn that she went missing three years ago. While the other male survivors adapt accordingly to this new world, Reito instead chooses to pursue Elisa, fight never-ending temptation, and investigate this mysterious virus.
