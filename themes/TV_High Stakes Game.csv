""We're friends forever!"" She treasures her memories of her old friend from when she was little, Morikawa Chinatsu, and she's excited at the prospect of meeting her again.

But when she gets to school, she finds she has trouble fitting in with the rest of the class.

One day, she decides that if she learns to play the card game WIXOSS, she might be able to make some friends. She stops at a card shop on her way home and buys a deck set. When she takes the set home and opens it, the girl on one of the cards begins to move, and speak.

""Welcome, Selector.""

Humans chosen as Selectors must battle for control of the five coins that hold all their memories.

If they can retake all the coins, they win, and can leave the game. But if they lose, as a penalty—

""Lostorage""—What will become of Suzuko as she's caught up in this insane game?

And just like Suzuko, Chinatsu finds herself drawn into the game as well...

Despite having no friends at school, Yukiteru is frequently seen talking to his supposedly imaginary friends Deus Ex Machina, the god of time and space; and Deus' servant, Mur Mur.

One day, Yukiteru wakes up and discovers that certain events of his day are preemptively displayed on his cellphone. While initially dismissing it as a coincidence, he slowly realizes that the incidents written in his phone actually take place in the near future. After spending the day benefiting from this new asset, Yukiteru learns that his classmate Yuno Gasai possesses a similar diary.

As the two team up to defeat an odd pursuer and head back to their respective homes, Deus Ex Machina explains that they—alongside 10 other contestants—have been drawn into a survival game whose victor will become the deity's successor. With no other options, Yukiteru and Yuno must use their cellphones—now called ""Future Diaries""—to survive this unforgiving battle royale.

Former Goddess Leche awoke from a long slumber and declared to the world, ""Bring forth the person who is the best in games in this era!"" Fay is nominated to represent humanity as the ""best rookie in recent years.""

The ""Game of the Gods"" that is about to begin between the two may be a little too difficult, as there has yet to be a victor throughout human history, because Gods are capricious, very unreasonable, and sometimes completely incomprehensible. However, given the nature of the games, it would be a waste not to have a good time and play with all of one's heart! The ultimate brain battles of a genius gamer boy, a former Goddess, and friends begin!
