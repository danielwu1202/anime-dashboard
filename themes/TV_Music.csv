Out of the 25 students in the division, five of them will receive a training role and actively participate as an actor in the program alongside the graduating class. Attaining one of these coveted spots will not only increase a student's academic standing within the department, but it will also put them in the running for a position on the elite Kao Council.

While every student in the department strives to obtain one of the five training roles, Team Yuzuriha's Riku Ageha is practically a front-runner for the role of Alexis' Shadow. Having idolized an Ayanagi alumnus' performance of Alexis, Ageha has spent a majority of his life perfecting the portrayal in hopes of being selected for the show. In contrast, Hoshitani's lack of experience in show-biz puts him at a great disadvantage for any of the roles in the production.

Though shocked that her father is trusting her with such a major project so soon, Tsumugi vows to do everything she can to support the seven young boys. After seeing how well the boys work as a team, Tsumugi meets with her father and learns that her first job as manager will be to cut four boys from the group.

She returns to the boys and they are thrilled that none of them will get to miss out on their dreams. Together they become IDOLiSH7, and prepare to take on the fiercely competitive world of idols.

Yuuya's apathetic attitude toward the fans and inability to take his job seriously causes his manager to give him an ultimatum: unless he starts putting in more effort, he will be fired.

Backstage, Yuuya meets Asahi Mogami, an idol dressed in a colorful costume. Asahi would have had a bright future ahead of her—had she not died a year prior. Even as a ghost, Asahi wants nothing more than to perform for fans again. When she finds out that Yuuya does not hold the same passion for the idol life that she once did, she is overcome by a fit of rage and demands that he let her take his place. In a strange twist, Yuuya wakes up to find that Asahi has possessed him and can do what he is too lazy to do himself.

With Asahi performing for him, Yuuya thinks he has a ticket to an easy idol life. However, Asahi has other plans. Though she is no longer alive, she wishes for Yuuya to find the ambition that she still has. Together, she wants them to become the best idol the world has ever seen.
