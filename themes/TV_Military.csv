A massive air raid on Sapporo that day kills thousands, including one of Shuuji's friends, and signals the beginning of a war.

Against her will, she has been transformed into the ultimate cyborg weapon, capable of leveling entire cities.

As the war rages closer and closer to their hometown, Chise and Shuuji's relationship is strained by her transformation, and they are left to wonder whether she is even still human.
