48804,Isekai Shokudou 2,異世界食堂 2,Restaurant to Another World 2,"The Western Restaurant Nekoya is adored by its local Japanese clientele. The eatery's continued success can be attributed to its tasty western and Japanese dishes, as well as its cheerful head chef, ""Master"" Tenshu. In Japan, the restaurant appears to be closed on Saturdays, but in actuality, it is the one day that Nekoya transcends to the Other World and opens its doors to guests seeking foreign cuisine. From castles to forests, the ""Restaurant to Another World""—as its patrons call it—travels far and wide. 

Nekoya's diverse and bizarre clientele can expect to be greeted by one of two devoted waitresses—the courteous demon waitress Aletta, or the enigmatic and elven Kuro. As customers, both old and new, pile into the establishment with stories of their respective lands, Master and his staff ensure that everyone is in for a scrumptious adventure of a lifetime.
